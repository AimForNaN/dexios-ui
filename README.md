# Dexios UI

Laying a foundation for you to build on, Dexios UI does not attempt to force you to adhere to any standard.
Providing you with a sound foundation, you are free to manipulate and implement according to your project's needs.

### Documentation

Dexios UI makes use of [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) for documentation, examples, among other things.
Run this command to launch a local instance.

```shell
npm start
```

Or you can skim through the docs yourself [here](src/stories/docs) or skim through component examples [here](src/stories/components/html).
