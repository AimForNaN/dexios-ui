Used to apply an inset ring that is one pixel wide by default and ring color.
Uses arbitrary values for specifying color, shade and ring width.
The ring color will take on the color of the arbitrary value.

Expected syntax for arbitrary value is in the `[color-shade_width]` form.

```css
ui-outline-inner-[zinc-300]
ui-outline-inner-[zinc-300_4]
ui-outline-inner-[black_2]
```
