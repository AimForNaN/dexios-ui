# Dexios UI 

A set of Tailwind utilities to assist in the development of UI components.

It is assumed that you have a good understanding of Tailwind.
We took much of our inspiration from shadcn UI, Tailwind UI, and Radix UI.
While we attempt to provide default styles that require no further modifications, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
Being merely a Tailwind plugin, all styles can be modified in the typical Tailwind fashion.
We make use of arbitrary values wherever possible to ease the process even further.
With Dexios UI you're not forced to use any component framework like React, Vue, etc.

## Installation 

```shell
npm install @truefusion/dexios-ui --save
```

After installation, you will need to apply the preset to your Tailwind configuration.

```js
import dexios from '@truefusion/dexios-ui';

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
	presets: [
		dexios,
	],
}
```

This will automatically apply all available Dexios UI plugins, making them immediately available for your project.

## Getting started

Everything is as simple as applying a base style followed by some utilities.
All solid and outline utility classes support arbitrary color values and inherit from `dexios-ui-outline` and `dexios-ui-solid` utility classes respectively,
which themselves support arbitrary color values in the form of `[color-shade]`.
Dexios UI will automatically determine suitable matching colors based on the provided base color wherever necessary.
In cases that do not inherit from either `dexios-ui-outline` or `dexios-ui-solid`, documentation and examples will follow.

#### Styling elements

For base elements, it is recommended to apply the styles directly to the base elements.

```css
@layer base {
	button {
		@apply btn-base btn-solid-[zinc-800] hover:btn-solid-[zinc-900];
	}
}
```

Alternatively, 

```html
<button class="btn-base btn-solid-[zinc-900]">Button</button>
```
