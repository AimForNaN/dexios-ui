# Dexios UI 

A set of Tailwind utilities to assist in the development of UI components.

It is assumed that you have a good understanding of Tailwind.
We took much of our inspiration from shadcn UI, Tailwind UI, and Radix UI.
While we attempt to provide default styles that require no further modifications, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
Being merely a Tailwind plugin, all styles can be modified in the typical Tailwind fashion.
We make use of arbitrary values wherever possible to ease the process even further.
With Dexios UI you're not forced to use any component framework like React, Vue, etc.

## Installation 

```shell
npm install @truefusion/dexios-ui --save
```

After installation, you will need to apply the preset to your Tailwind configuration.

```js
import dexios from '@truefusion/dexios-ui';

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
	presets: [
		dexios,
	],
}
```

This will automatically apply all available Dexios UI plugins, making them immediately available for your project.

## Getting started

Everything is as simple as applying a base style followed by some utilities.

For base elements, it is recommended to apply the styles directly to the base elements.

```css
@layer base {
	button {
		@apply ui-btn-base ui-btn-solid-[zinc-800] hover:ui-btn-solid-[zinc-900];
	}
}
```

Alternatively, 

```html
<button class="ui-btn-base ui-btn-solid-[zinc-900]">Button</button>
```

## Style recommendations

See the login form example for an example of these recommendations.

#### Text colors

For text with a plain background we recommend a shade of 950.
For a lower contrast you can drop that down to 800.
For secondary text with a plain background we recommend a shade of either 700 or 500.

#### Sections

When dividing content into sections, pick a large initial padding size.
Initial gap size should be half the initial padding.
Nested sections should contain only components that are related to each other.
For every level you dive into, divide the gap size by half.
If you run out of sizes, you probably nested too deeply or didn't start off with a large enough padding size.
